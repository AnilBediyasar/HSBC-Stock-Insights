This project combine machine learning and trading strategies in financial markets:

1. **Machine-Learning-in-Financial-Markets**: This project leverages machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Classifier to predict stock market trends. Specifically, it analyzes the past four days' returns to forecast whether HSBC stocks will have a positive or negative return on the current day. The project involves comparing the accuracy of these models to determine which one performs best in this financial prediction task.

2. **Moving-Average-Trading-Strategy-with-Python**: This project implements a simple trading strategy using moving averages. The strategy uses the difference between slow and fast moving averages of a stock's adjusted closing price to generate trading signals. The goal is to describe and optimize this strategy using Python, focusing on finding the most effective parameters for trading success.

Together, this project offer a powerful combination of predictive analytics and strategic trading optimization in finance.


 **Developed and Optimized Trading Strategies:** Designed and implemented a moving average trading strategy using Python, optimizing fast (45) and slow (115) moving averages. Achieved a remarkable strategy return of 265.837% compared to a market return of 28.718%, significantly enhancing stock trading decisions.

 **Data Acquisition and Analysis:** Utilized `yfinance` for downloading and preprocessing historical stock data, including adjusted close prices and volume. Calculated log returns, moving averages, and generated trading signals based on moving average crossovers. Employed quantitative analysis to refine strategy parameters.

 **Implemented Machine Learning Models:** Developed and optimized machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVC) to predict daily stock returns for HSBC. Achieved a peak model accuracy of 59% and detailed precision and recall metrics for positive and negative returns.

  **Performance Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluated strategy and model performance using metrics such as total returns, annualized volatility, and classification reports. Created detailed visualizations with Python libraries (`matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`) to present stock price movements, moving averages, cumulative returns, and model performance metrics.

 **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy:** Analyzed financial time series data to identify stock price patterns and the impact of diminishing return dependencies. Highlighted the importance of additional predictive features like news sentiment and macroeconomic indicators, recognizing limitations of traditional models in capturing market movements.
