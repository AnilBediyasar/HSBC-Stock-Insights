This project combine machine learning and trading strategies in financial markets:

1. **Machine-Learning-in-Financial-Markets**: This project leverages machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Classifier to predict stock market trends. Specifically, it analyzes the past four days' returns to forecast whether HSBC stocks will have a positive or negative return on the current day. The project involves comparing the accuracy of these models to determine which one performs best in this financial prediction task.

2. **Moving-Average-Trading-Strategy-with-Python**: This project implements a simple trading strategy using moving averages. The strategy uses the difference between slow and fast moving averages of a stock's adjusted closing price to generate trading signals. The goal is to describe and optimize this strategy using Python, focusing on finding the most effective parameters for trading success.

Together, this project offer a powerful combination of predictive analytics and strategic trading optimization in finance.
